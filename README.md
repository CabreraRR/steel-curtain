## Steel Curtain
Steel Curtain is a small mod for the game [Factorio](https://factorio.com/). It is primarily used by myself and it's co-creator [Roel Cabrera](https://github.com/cabrerarr)

### Additions

1. Adds in a new steel wall with **1000 HP**.
2. Adds in a new level of Power Armor, Power Armor MK3
3. Adds in a new type of personal laser turret. This turret fits on a 1x1 grid instead of a 2x2 grid and fires much _faster_ and _harder_
4. Adds in a new level of portable fusion reactor.

## Modifications

  There is one technology that I just _had_ to modify given the chance. The portable solar items. Seriously, those were terrible.

* Portable Solar Panel Power increased from something weak as shit to 1MW. I will probably play around with this number later. 
 * Yes, I am aware that it makes the item better than the initial Portable Fusion Reactor. I don't care.
